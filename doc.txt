The provided code implements a custom hash table data structure using separate chaining for collision handling. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Custom Hash Function (customHash):
This function takes a string str and an optional hashSize (default: 53) as input.
It calculates a hash code for the input string using a simple hash function that iterates over the characters and performs modular arithmetic.
The hash function uses the prime number 31 as a multiplier to help distribute the hash codes more evenly.
The final hash code is returned as the result.

Node Class (Node):
This class represents a node in a linked list.
Each node has a key, value, and a reference to the next node in the list.

Separate Chaining Class (SeparateChaini<wbr>ng):
This class implements the separate chaining technique for collision handling in the hash table.
It has an array of buckets (this.buckets), where each bucket is a linked list.
The insert method calculates the hash code for the given key using the customHash function and inserts the key-value pair into the corresponding bucket's linked list.
The get method calculates the hash code for the given key and traverses the corresponding bucket's linked list to find the value associated with the key.
The delete method calculates the hash code for the given key and removes the corresponding key-value pair from the bucket's linked list.

HashTable Class (HashTable):
This class serves as a wrapper around the SeparateChainin<wbr>g class, providing a simple interface for working with the hash table.
It has a hashSize property (default: 53) and an instance of the SeparateChainin<wbr>g class (this.buckets).
The insert, get, and delete methods delegate the respective operations to the SeparateChainin<wbr>g instance.

Test Function (runTests):
This function demonstrates the usage of the HashTable class by performing various operations and printing the expected outputs.
It tests the insert, get, delete, and collision handling scenarios.

Analysis:
The performance of the custom hash table implementation depends on the efficiency of the hash function and the collision handling mechanism.

Hash Function Performance:
The customHash function has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the length of the input string. This is because it iterates over each character of the string once.
The hash function is simple and efficient, but it may not distribute the hash codes evenly for all input strings, leading to potential collisions.

Insertion Performance:
The time complexity of the insert operation is O(1) on average, assuming a good hash function that distributes the keys evenly across the buckets.
In the worst case, where all keys hash to the same bucket, the time complexity becomes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the bucket's linked list.

Retrieval Performance:
The time complexity of the get operation is O(1) on average, assuming a good hash function and even distribution of keys across buckets.
In the worst case, where all keys hash to the same bucket, the time complexity becomes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the bucket's linked list.

Deletion Performance:
The time complexity of the delete operation is O(1) on average, assuming a good hash function and even distribution of keys across buckets.
In the worst case, where all keys hash to the same bucket, the time complexity becomes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the bucket's linked list.

Trade-offs: 
- The separate chaining implementation handles collisions by creating linked lists in each bucket. This approach has the advantage of allowing unlimited key-value pairs to be stored in the hash table, but it can lead to performance degradation if the number of collisions becomes too high. 
- The choice of the hash size (prime number 53 in this case) can affect the distribution of keys across buckets and the likelihood of collisions. A larger hash size can reduce collisions but may increase memory usage. 
- The custom hash function used in this implementation is simple and may not distribute the keys evenly for all input strings, potentially leading to more collisions.

Overall, the provided implementation offers a balance between simplicity and performance, with the separate chaining technique handling collisions effectively.
